One core advantage of freelancing is the ability to research and experiment with cutting-edge technologies and offer innovative solutions tailored to the client. I continue to gain and impart knowledge in the open source market. Web projects for KRO offered innovative solutions, using OSS frameworks and libraries, at a fraction of the cost clients would expect to pay large consultancies for same.
